# Querying WATT Balance

After WATTs are issued to users, developers and applications may want to query and ascertain the amount of WATTs associated with a particular account. The WATTs provide insights into the algorithmic identity, reputation, and influence of the user across various platforms.

1. **Accessing the WATT Balance**:

   To determine the WATT balance of a specific user, you would typically call a function similar to `balanceOf` on the contract managing the WATTs. Here's a generic example:

```solidity
WATTContract watt = WATTContract(<WATT_Contract_Address>); uint256 userBalance = watt.balanceOf(<User_Address>);
```

In this example, replace `<WATT_Contract_Address>` with the actual contract address of the WATT token or system. Similarly, replace `<User_Address>` with the Ethereum address of the user whose balance you want to query.

- **Interpreting the Query**:
  The returned `userBalance` represents the number of WATTs associated with the specified user. This balance can be utilized in various applications, from smart contracts to off-chain analytics, to derive insights about the user's interactions and reputation within the Newcoin ecosystem.
