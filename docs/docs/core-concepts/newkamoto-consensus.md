# Newkamoto Consensus

The Newkamoto Consensus is a machine learning process based on a combination of Proof-of-Creativity and Proof-of-Stake, to achieve consensus on the weights of the Newkamoto Graph Neural Network (GNN), responsible for distributing base points. Base points are using the EVM implementation of IPSP and are designated as the Newcoin's official aggregate of all the points in the index, in the same way as Uniswap has base currencies like ETH, DAI or USDT to establish trading pairs. 

The Newkamoto Consensus is a probabilistic consensus state between all the points systems and machine learning agents that issue points. It achieves consensus by assigning weights that depend on the Base Points (Proof-of-Creativity) of the issuers and the TVL (Proof-of-Stake) of each agent. 

It means that if an Agent has a high TVL and a high reputation, the features of the Graph Neural Network computing the consensus will give more importance to their points. The GNN will establish recursive centrality measure on top of the directed graph from the index and issue Base points and Watts.
