# Activation Function


## Introduction

Activation Functions play a pivotal role in Newcoin's decentralized architecture, orchestrating the systematic validation of creativity within the network. Rooted in intricate algorithms, they determine how and when Neural Tokens are minted, encapsulating the essence of creative acknowledgment.

## Understanding Activation Functions

### The Mechanism

At a high level, Activation Functions serve as algorithmic evaluators within the Newcoin ecosystem. They process various input parameters, executing logic that determines if a particular creative action or contribution is valid and worthy of recognition in the form of Neural Tokens.

### The Role of Parameters

Parameters form the foundation of Activation Functions. These configurable elements influence how Activation Functions discern the merit of creative actions. Parameter classes span a diverse range: Threshold, Duration, Multiplier, Cap, Quadratic function, Logarithm, Square root, and beyond.

## Encoder: The Gatekeeper

The Encoder.nco.eth contract stands guard, overseeing the registration of approved Activation Functions. Holding exclusive rights, it directs the PoC.nco.eth to mint Neural Tokens, but only upon the successful validation and execution of an Activation Function.

## Activation Functions in Action

### Evaluating Creativity

Each Activation Function is uniquely calibrated to recognize specific forms of creativity within the Newcoin network. Whether it's the creation of a groundbreaking digital art piece or a notable contribution to a decentralized project, Activation Functions ensure that genuine creative endeavors receive their due acknowledgment.

### Triggering Neural Token Generation

Upon successful validation by an Activation Function, a request is relayed to the Encoder. Once the Encoder verifies the validity of this request, it instructs the PoC.nco.eth contract to mint the corresponding Neural Tokens.

## Implications & Applications

### Dynamic Adaptability

As the landscape of creativity evolves, so can Activation Functions. New parameters can be introduced, and existing ones tweaked, ensuring that the Newcoin ecosystem remains responsive to the multifaceted nature of creativity.

### Transparency & Trust

Each Activation Function, being on-chain, offers complete transparency. Participants within the Newcoin network can verify the logic and criteria set by these functions, fostering an environment of trust and accountability.

### Expanding the Neural Token Spectrum

The versatility of Activation Functions means that a diverse array of Neural Tokens (SWATT, NWATT, XWATT, etc.) can be generated. Each token type, while rooted in the same foundational principles, can cater to different facets of creativity, enhancing the granularity of recognition.

## Conclusion

Activation Functions embody the precision and adaptability that Newcoin champions. They are the algorithmic sentinels, tirelessly evaluating, acknowledging, and rewarding the myriad expressions of creativity within the decentralized realm. As the Newcoin ecosystem grows, Activation Functions will continue to evolve, ensuring that every genuine creative pulse finds its rightful acknowledgment.
