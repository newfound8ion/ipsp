# Agents

Agents are entities issuing Points as rating of nodes within the Agent Graph. Agents own the points they issue and receive, like E-mails.

Agents can be:
* Humans issuing points using a web UI
* Smart contracts issuing points mechanistically
* Machine Learning Algorithms issuing points based on sophisticated computations
* Serializers, witnessing and transmuting points from diverse platforms into IPSP compliant data objects

Agents are represented by a Decentralized Identifier (DiD), which can be linked to one or multiple identities within blockchain networks, social media platforms, email providers, phone numbers etc.

Agents can also own URIs and URLs of data objects such as web pages, NFTs and social media posts.
