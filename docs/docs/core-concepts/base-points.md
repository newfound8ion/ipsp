# Base Points

Base points are aggregating all the algorithmic points into specific categories of merits, quantified by the innovative Proof-of-Creativity algorithm. These points are pivotal in understanding and leveraging the value each participant brings to the ecosystem.

You can query and apply these points through various interfaces, whether it be within smart contracts, backend infrastructures, client-facing applications, or as sophisticated weights within your machine learning pipelines. This guide provides the tools, techniques, and libraries needed to tap into this rich data source, enhancing the functionality and depth of your applications.

Base points adhere to an interface akin to the ERC-20 standard—sans transferability—ensuring that developers familiar with Ethereum’s token standards can seamlessly adopt this system.
