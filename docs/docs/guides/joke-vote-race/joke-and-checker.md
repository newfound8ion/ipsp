### **Step 2: Interacting with JokeVote using VoteChecker**

The VoteChecker contract interacts with JokeVote to verify whether an address has cast its vote.

**A. Setting Up the Interaction**

We need to set up the VoteChecker contract to interact with the JokeVote contract using an interface.

```solidity
interface VotingContract {
    function addressTotalVotesVerified() external view returns (bool);
}
```

**B. Implementing the Vote Verification**

We utilize the function `activate` to interact with the JokeVote contract and check the voting status of an address.

```solidity
function activate() public view returns (bool) {
    VotingContract votingContract = VotingContract(votingContractAddress);
    return votingContract.addressTotalVotesVerified();
}
```
