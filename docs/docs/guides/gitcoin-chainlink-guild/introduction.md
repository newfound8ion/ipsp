# Introduction

In this guide we are going to create an Activation Function that registers a certain degree of proof of humanity.

This will be done by utilising [gitcoin passport](https://passport.gitcoin.co), which takes different on chain and off chain proofs to register a score indicating a certain degree of trust in the users humanity.

By having a score over 25, the user is then able to request access to the [guild.xyz Gitcoin Passport](https://guild.xyz/gitcoinpassport) membership. Members of this guild can therefore be attested to a strong liklihood of humanity.

We will create an Activation Function that checks for membership of the Gitcoin Passsport guild. This will then be submitted to the Encoder along with a certain weighting of Neural Tokens to be converted to Watts, which can then be triggered by the user to issue tokens to themselves as members of the guild and holders of a Gitcoin Passport.
