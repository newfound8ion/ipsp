# Immutable Points Standard Protocol (IPSP)
### Powered by Newcoin 


Immutable Points Standard protocol (IPSP) is a standard way to issue ‘points’ which are non-monetary, yet numerical representation of merits for users, contracts, or data objects across the Internet.

Points are numerical representations of value within contexts. For instance, within a basketball match, points represent the success of the teams. They have indirect economic consequences such as championship, sponsorship, bets and the career of individual players, but they can’t be purchased, which is why they are valuable and complementary to financial assets such as shares, currencies and tokens. We also call them “meta-currencies” are they inform, orient and guide the flow of monetary currencies.

In the digital space, points as meta-currencies are used across a wide range of network topologies such as:
Social media, where follows, likes and comments are counted both by users and algorithms to help coordinate the curation and ranking of content.
Search engines where the amount of hyperlinks and the scoring of web pages plays a key role in filtering the quality of the content.
Video games, where the success of the player is rewarded, measurable and unlocks new levels and accomplishments.
Data science pipelines: the main factor that determines the quality of a model is the amount of parameters which are numerical values that weight data outputs and computations and rewards the model with points during the training process. More recently the RLHF concept allowed models to learn directly from the end-user through feedback which are another type of points.

In contrast, the crypto-space is primarily using financial assets as points: from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake to token voting, most merits are financial in nature, leading to an over-financialized space that is disconnected from real value creation. 
As a response, the DeSoc paper (Weyl, Ohlhaver, Buterin ~ May 10, 2022) alongside many efforts in this direction advocate the need for the accounting of merits of internet users using badges and credentials. Those credentials and attestations are powerful within contexts, but are challenging to measure, interoperate and account for within a broader context. So how do we scale the true measurement of value without turning into a monolithic system like Google or Facebook? The answer lies in standardization:

Built on top of the W3C standards, IPSP aims at shaping a universal graph with Points as the core primitive. IPSP defines how meta-currencies are issued, distributed, computed and derive utility across the web3 ecosystem.

The Immutable Points Standard Protocol (IPSP) is a decentralized, privacy-preserving framework designed to standardize and scale the interoperability of Points across various platforms. IPSP transforms numerical Points, indicative of user engagement and achievements, into a universal metric contextualized by verifiable credentials, enhancing their meaning and ensuring privacy through selective disclosure mechanisms.

By leveraging decentralized interpreter networks, IPSP unlocks the formation of an open behavioral machine learning pipeline to establish an eventually consistent probabilistic state of the true value created within the web3 ecosystem. This approach not only breaks down silos between different digital platforms but also fosters a cohesive and interconnected web3 ecosystem.
